# Strategy Design Pattern

- ### It is a behavioral design pattern

- ### It defines a family of algorithms

- ### Encapsulates each one of them

- ### The algorithms can be interchangeable.

#### This type of design pattern is useful when you want to use different varient of algorithm.

- When to Use

  -> Multiple Algorithms: When you have different algorithms for a specific task and you want to switch between them.

  -> Eliminate Conditional Statements: When you have a lot of conditionals that switch between different algorithms or behaviors.

  -> Open/Closed Principle: When you want to adhere to the open/closed principle, making the system open for extension but closed for modification.
